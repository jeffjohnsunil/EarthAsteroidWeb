# Earth Asteroid Web

As the world progresses, world problems such as global warming and poverty dominate media outlets. However, a pressing, yet invisible issue, presses humanity: Space Debris. This is a problem that can wipe out billions of dollars of research and confine our efforts of exploration to Earth, and awareness for the problem is limited. For my HPQ, I created a website and promoted it to raise awareness of space debris.

The website is split into three menus: 
- A homepage, which serves as a landing page and gives basic information about space debris.
- An info page, which delves into more detail about asteroid classification and includes a simulation
- A calculator page, which receives user input about the velocity, size, and density of any asteroid and outputs useful information on it. 

This website is available in this domain: https://www.earthasteroidweb.live.
